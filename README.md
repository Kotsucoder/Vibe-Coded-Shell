# Vibe-Coded Shell

![A demonstration of the Vibe-Coded Shell in action.](hero.jpg)

This project is a POSIX-compliant shell built in Python. What makes it special is its origin: every line of code was generated by Google's Gemini, with a human developer (me!) acting as the guide. 

This repository is a public journal of this experiment, created for two main reasons.

## Project Goals

1.  **Putting AI to the Test**: Just how capable are modern AI tools at writing functional, compliant systems software? This shell serves as a tangible answer, showcasing the strengths and weaknesses of AI-driven development in a real-world scenario.

2.  **Sharpening My Code Review Skills**: The second purpose is a personal development goal. By tasking an AI to write the code, I've created a unique opportunity to hone my own code review abilities. My work here is to rigorously inspect the AI's output for correctness, efficiency, and security, documenting my findings and refining the code. It’s a public exercise in holding machine-generated code to human-led standards.

## A Note for Visitors & Recruiters

Welcome! This repository is more than just a collection of code; it's an active workshop.

### For the Curious
I invite you to follow along as I review, comment on, and refine the code generated by Gemini. You can see this process unfold in the commits and pull requests. Your suggestions and insights are always welcome!

### For Recruiters
This project demonstrates a forward-thinking and proactive approach to software engineering, highlighting:
*   **AI Collaboration & Guidance**: Skill in effectively prompting and guiding AI tools to create complex, functional software.
*   **Critical Code Analysis**: A disciplined process of reviewing, testing, and validating AI-generated code to ensure it meets high standards for quality, readability, and security.
*   **Commitment to Professional Growth**: The initiative to create personal challenges and publicly document the process of improving core software development skills.
*   **Technical Foundation**: Strong practical knowledge of Python, shell architecture, and POSIX standards.

## Getting Started

To run the shell, simply execute the Python script:
```bash
python3 shell.py
```
